/// 01. Fonts (@font-face rules)
/// 02. Utilities (Variables, functions, mixins, etc)
/// 03. Base (HTML elements, such as <header>, <footer>, <main>, etc)
/// 04. Modules (modules, background, colors, typography)
/// 05. States (JavaScript-related Sass)
/// 06. Shame (Any code that would otherwise be marked with a TODO elsewhere)
